With the growing popularity of Reddit review videos on YouTube and channels like [rSlash](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0-swBG9Ne0Vh4OuoJ2bjbA), this project tried to leverage automation to create Reddit-based YouTube videos with a variety of flavors and topics. This project is now defunct due to the limitations of processing and rendering large amounts of content on a daily basis. However, over the projects 9-month lifespan, over 600 videos were uploaded and and viewed over 7,000 times total.
